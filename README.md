## Overview

This code contains two directories, slr and lib. slr contains code for analyzing tide gauge data and generating sea-level rise projections. lib contains supporting files.

This code requires MATLAB to run. It uses the Optimization and Mapping toolkits, though some of the functionality should be available without those toolkits. It also requires one of two routines to invert the spherical harmonics of the sea-level fingerprint files. By default, the code uses ssht (https://astro-informatics.github.io/ssht/index.html), although a slower MATLAB-based routine by Frederik Simons is included and can be used as a fallback. 

Needed input files, which go in the IFILES directory (specified in configureSLRProjections). These include:

	* the CSIRO GSL reconstruction,
	* the ICE5G-VM290 GIA model (NetCDF),
	* land ice static-equilibrium fingerprints,
	* Marzeion et al. 2012 glacier and ice cap projections,
	* PSMSL tide gauge data.

## Sea level rise projections

runTrainGPSLModel.m will generate a set of parameter files with optimized hyperparameters for each of the regions described in the coastlines.txt parameter files. (It is recommended that you use the default specifications, which are stored in slr/PARAMS; the training process is slow).

runSLRProjections.m will generate the sea-level rise projections, using the configuration specified in configureSLRProjections.m and generating the output files specified in outputSLRProjections.m. You will need the slr/, slr/MFILES, and slr/MFILES/scripts directories in your path.

You will need to modify the paths in configureSLRProjections.m to match your system.
